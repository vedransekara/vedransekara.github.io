Ok, I know that I'm a bit late in posting this, but results form one of my papers [<a title="Measuring large-scale social networks with high resolution" href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7233">link</a>] was featured in <a title="Forbes-link" href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/adamtanner/2014/03/12/starting-today-jealous-lovers-can-buy-nsa-like-monitoring-powers/">Forbes Magazine</a>.

The article is about data collection campaigns (hint: NSA), but also mentions our <a title="SensibleDTU â€“ 2012" href="https://vedransekara.github.io/2013-07-29-sensibleDTU">SensibleDTU</a> project. Basically how I see it, the issue is not about whether data collection is good or bad, but how we as researchers/organizations/countries decide to use this data.
