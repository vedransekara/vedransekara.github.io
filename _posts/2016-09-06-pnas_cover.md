title: On the cover of PNAS!!!
---

<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/36/9977.full"><img src="/images/2016/pnas_cover.png" class="fit image"></a>
We ([Sune Lehmann](https://sunelehmann.com), [Arek Stopczynski](https://stopczynski.com/) and yours truly) recently published a paper in PNAS where we give our two cents on how to uncover meaningful, _"fundamental"_, social structures from temporal complex networks.
In addition to submitting the paper we also sent some pictures along which we felt would look good on the cover of PNAS.
As it turns out one of them was actually selected!

Check out the cover [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/36.toc), and if you are interested in the paper you can find it [here](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/36/9977.full).
I am very proud of the work we did and I have got to say, it feels amazing to be on the cover of PNAS!
