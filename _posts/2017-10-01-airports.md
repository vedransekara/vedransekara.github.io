title: Global Airport Network

I like to keep track of my life; collecting data about random things--one of them happens to be my travel patterns.
While visualizing my own travels I started to wonder what the global airport network might look like.
I remember reading about the structure of the airport network in [_the architecture of complex weighted networks_](http://www.pnas.org/content/101/11/3747.short) by A. Barrat et al. but the paper never visualized the network. 
To figure it out, I first needed some data, luckily [OpenFlights.org](https://openflights.org/data.html) has a database of routes as well as airports, which allows us to create some pretty nice looking visualizations (see above figure).

### Code
First lets import some packages, there are tons of good plotting libraries, I personally love [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) because it allows you to customize everything. 
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from collections import Counter
import random
```

Next let's load the data. As multiple airline companies can fly the same route I have chosen to count the number of flights between airports and weight links between cities accordingly.
```python
# load airport data
data = pd.read_csv('airports.csv')

# load route data
edges = Counter()
with open('routes.csv') as f:
    next(f)
    for line in f:
        airline,airline_id,source,source_id,destination,destination_id,codeshare,stops,equipment = line.split(',')
        edges[min(source_id,destination_id),max(source_id,destination_id)] += 1

pos = dict(map(lambda x: (str(x[0]),(x[1],x[2])), data[['airport_id','longitude','latitude']].values))
```

Finally we define a plotter function, here I use [basemaps](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/) to draw the globe (using an orthographic projection) and to plot routes (using great circles). 
Unfortunately we need to use a hack as the function [drawgreatcircle](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/api/basemap_api.html#mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap.drawgreatcircle) will give wrong results if the end points of the great circle are not located in the same field of view.
```python
def world(lat0,lon0,color):
    # construct map projection
    m = Basemap(projection='ortho',lat_0=lat0,lon_0=lon0,resolution='c')
    # draw coastlines, country boundaries, fill continents.
    #m.drawcoastlines(linewidth=0.1,color='white')
    m.fillcontinents(color='#515151',lake_color='#282828')
    # draw the edge of the map projection region (the projection limb)
    m.drawmapboundary(fill_color='#282828')

    # transform points
    count = 0
    for (ei,ej),w in edges.items():
        if ei in pos and ej in pos:
            # draw routes
            # get coordinates for great circle
            x, y = map(np.array,m.gcpoints(pos[ei][0],pos[ei][1],pos[ej][0],pos[ej][1], 150))
            m.plot([x[j] for j in range(len(x)) if x[j] < 10e20 and y[j] <= 10e20], # small hack
                   [y[j] for j in range(len(y)) if x[j] < 10e20 and y[j] <= 10e20],color=color,lw=w*0.1,alpha=0.1)
```

To create the above figure we use:
```python
# draw points on globe
plt.figure(figsize=(12,3))

plt.subplot(1,4,1)
world(0,-90,'#00AEEF')

plt.subplot(1,4,2)
world(0,0,'#00AEEF')

plt.subplot(1,4,3)
world(0,90,'#00AEEF')

plt.subplot(1,4,4)
world(0,180,'#00AEEF')
plt.tight_layout()

plt.savefig('airports.png',transparent=True,dpi=300)
plt.close()
```

Varying the _lat0_ and _long0_ parameters allows us to rotate the globe. 
Combining this with [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) and choosing a bit more gloomy color scheme we can create the below gif.
