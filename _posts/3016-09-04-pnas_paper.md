title: New paper in PNAS!
---

It has has taken quite some time to get this paper into shape (I previously blogged about it [here](/2015/02/01/next_big_thing.html) - 1.5 years ago), but it's finally out.
I think it's a nice paper, and I'm very proud that my coauthors, [Sune Lehmann](https://sunelehmann.com) & [Arek Stopczynski](https://stopczynski.com/) and I managed to get it accepted in PNAS. (*fun fact*: Sune and Arek use identical templates for their personal webpages).
We somehow even managed to give it the not-so-humble title _Fundamental Structures of Dynamic Social Networks_.
The publication of this paper, moreover, concludes the work I presented in my PhD dissertation.

Although it has been possible to read the paper, for quite some time, on the _early content_ page of PNAS it is now out in printed format - you can read it [right here](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/22/1602803113.abstract).
In addition, to the paper itself the editors at PNAS thought it was such an important paper that they asked Renaud Lambiotte to write a [commentary](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/08/22/1612364113.extract) about it.

Even though Sune already wrote a nice non-technical explanation about the paper [here](https://sunelehmann.com/2016/08/24/new-paper-in-pnas/), I will below try to emphasize some of my favorite findings.

### Making networks simpler

lacking temporal data networks are dense complex connected entities linking thousands of nodes, they usually look like hairball (far left network of below figure).
Finding *community* structure in this network is very difficult, so difficult that every year thousand of papers are published that address this very issue.
Many of the present amazing, but sophisticated algorithms. 
What we show, however, is that they are unnecessary.
Instead by changing the temporal resolution from years or days to hours or minutes we can directly observe structural elements.
Put in a different way, it is impossible to understand my social relations if you all the people i have intereacted with my friends together into one room, compared to when you do it one group at a time.

We observe something called gatherings 

network video!!

from gatherings we go to cores

cores can be applied to a variety of things.
