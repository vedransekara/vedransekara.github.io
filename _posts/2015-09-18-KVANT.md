title: On the cover of KVANT
---

<img src="/images/2015/kv153-forside.png" class="fit image"> While finalizing my PhD I was asked, alongside Sune Lehmann, to author a popular article about networks by the magazine Kvant (danish journal for physics and astronomy). We wrote and submitted the <a href="http://www.kvant.dk/issue.php?n=3&amp;y=2015">piece</a> and were fairly confident in our work. Nonetheless we were surprised when we were contacted by the editor who asked us for permission to use one of my figures for the cover!  This is my first cover, and I gotta say, it feels awesome, next stop .... Nature :)

The figure shows telephone communication patterns between approx 300 randomly chosen individuals from the <a href="https://vedransekara.github.io/2014-01-31-another_paper/"><em>Copenhagen Networks Study</em></a> over the course of two weeks.
