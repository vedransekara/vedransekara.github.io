# About

As a Research/Data Scientist I focus on modeling and understanding complex systems by utilizing high-resolution (big) data across multiple data-channels.
Currently my work focuses on modeling, describing and predicting human behavior. I have a comprehensive knowledge of network science and machine learning. In addition, I am highly experienced in working with large multiplex datasets, be it behavioral traces collected via apps installed on smartphones, interactions between proteins within cells, scientific articles from the Web of Science, photos on Flickr, taxi rides in NYC, or articles on Wikipedia.

I’m a PhD-graduate from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Technical University of Denmark [[pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xq21smyt3u7a9t9/2015_PhD_V.sekara.pdf?dl=0)].

Furthermore I’m a graduate from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen (B.Sc, Physics 2009 [[pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s7msgsaxrls02jr/2009_Bachelor_L.Mosgaard_V.Sekara.pdf?dl=0)], M.Sc, Physics, 2011 [[pdf](https://www.dropbox.com/s/f95ofcqoo2ynucy/2011_masters_V.Sekara.pdf?dl=0))
